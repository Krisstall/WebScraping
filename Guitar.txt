Watts wrote the words of \"Joy to the World\" as a hymn glorifying Christ's triumphant return at the end of the age,  rather than a song celebrating His first coming. Only the second half of Watts' lyrics are still used today. \n\nThe music was adapted and arranged to Watts' lyrics by Lowell Mason in 1839 from an older melody which was then believed to have originated from Handel, not least because the theme of the refrain (And heaven and nature sing...) appears in the orchestra opening and accompaniment of the recitative Comfort ye from Handel's Messiah, and the first four notes match the beginning of the choruses Lift up your heads and Glory to God from the same oratorio. However, Handel did not compose the entire tune. The name \"Antioch\" is generally used for the tune.\n\nLyrics\nJoy to the World, the Lord has come!\nLet earth receive her King;\nLet every heart prepare Him room,\nAnd Heaven and nature sing,\nAnd Heaven and nature sing,\nAnd Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.\n\nJoy to the World, the Savior reigns!\nLet men their songs employ;\nWhile fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains\nRepeat the sounding joy,\nRepeat the sounding joy,\nRepeat, repeat, the sounding joy.\n\nNo more let sins and sorrows grow,\nNor thorns infest the ground;\nHe comes to make His blessings flow\nFar as the curse is found,\nFar as the curse is found,\nFar as, far as, the curse is found.\n\nHe rules the world with truth and grace,\nAnd makes the nations prove\nThe glories of His righteousness,\nAnd wonders of His love,\nAnd wonders of His love,\nAnd wonders, wonders, of His love"},{"artist":"Bach  ","name":"Toccata and Fugue in D minor (excerpt)","difficulty":"Intermediate Level","url":"https://www.8notes.com/scores/2823.asp","img1":"/school/png/guitar/bach_toccata001.png","img2":"/school/png/guitar/bach_toccata002.png","midi":"/school/midi/guitar/bach_toccata.mid","about":"The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, is a piece of organ music written by Johann Sebastian Bach.

Sometimes the song is known by words from the refrain, \"Canta y no llores\" or simply the \"Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay\" song.\n\nCommonly played by mariachi bands, it has been recorded by many artists in the original Spanish as well as in English and other languages.

covered all over with purple and pall\nAnd I love my Lord Jesus above anything.\n\nIn that hall there stands a bed:\nThe bells of Paradise I heard them ring:\nIt's covered all over with scarlet so red:\nAnd I love my Lord Jesus above anything.\n\nAt the bed-side there lies a stone:\nThe bells of Paradise I heard them ring:\nWhich the sweet Virgin Mary knelt upon:\nAnd I love my Lord Jesus above anything.\n\nUnder that bed there runs a flood:\nThe bells of Paradise I heard them ring:\nThe one half runs water, the other runs blood:\nAnd I love my Lord Jesus above anything.\n\nAt the bed's foot there grows a thorn:\nThe bells of Paradise I heard them ring:\nWhich ever blows blossom since he was born:\nAnd I love my Lord Jesus above anything.\n\nOver that bed the moon shines bright:\nThe
